How to Play Battleships

This is a game of guessing, strategy, and logical thought that dates back to before WWI and is known internationally for being a simple game that can be played with no more than a pencil and two pieces of paper. It is a two player game which has since been released by many board game manufacturers. Its popularity can be seen through not only the intricate detail put into physical and digital renditions of it, but now also in a Hollywood film based on the game.

Start/Preparation

Each game can vary in the number of ships employed but a common practice is to have 5 ships of differing size (2 to 5 tiles). An aircraft carrier is 5 squares long, a battleship is 4 squares long, both a submarine and a cruiser are three squares long and a destroyer is two squares long. Each player must secretly place their ships on a ten by ten grid. These represent the location of their ships on their "battlefield". Each player will also be in possession of a second grid of the same size that represents what they currently know about their enemy's "battlefield". Both of these will be updated throughout the game.

Gameplay

Once it is determined who will go first, that person will pick a tile to guess, calling it by its column letter then row number (C3 for example). This represents them firing a missile directly at that square. If the opposing player has any part of one of their ships positioned on this square they must call “hit” and mark on their battlefield (first grid) which part has been hit. Equally, the attacking player will place an “X” on their blank grid (the mirror of their opponents field) to show a hit. If the guessed tile hit the last non-hit tile of the player's ship, they must declare that the opponent has sunk one of their ships and which ship was sunk ("you sunk my battleship" for example). The first person's turn is now over and the second player will now take their turn in the same manner.

Victory

The player who successfully locates all their opponent’s ships first by hitting each square they occupy and thus sinking all their ships is declared the winner.
